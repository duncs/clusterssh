Overview of tasks
=================

Config file
===========

Convert from file ~/.cssrch to directory ~/.clusterssh
For conversion process
- clusters in .csshrc should be placed into 'default.cluster'
- all other config should go into 'config'
- create default menu file 

New feature - if cssh -s symlinked to c_xxx then search for xxx as a cluster
file in .clutersshrc and open that

Getopts usage
=============

Set up similar to Nagios::Plugin where Getopts::Long is subclassed
Sort out docs too

Change way commands generated
=============================

Each scrpt file (cssh, crsh, ctelnet, cscp, crsync) should define how 
the command is created/used and also none-common options

# Something like the following (needs refinement):

$app->setup_command(
    "ssh %PORT% %USER% %HOSTNAME%",
    {
        %PORT% => [ $app->getopt->port, "-p %PORT%" ],
        %USER% => [ $app->getopt->username, "-l %USER%" ],
    }
)

Change way terminal windows are created
=======================================

Set up terminal windows in Tk to embedd termainl session into it, such as with
xterm
  xterm -wid <wid> ....

This may limit to terminal thats can reparent into a given window id though.
